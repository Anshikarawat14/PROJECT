**Voice and Text converter & text to voice converter**

This repository showcases my project where I've developed a versatile web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless conversion between speech and text. Whether you're 
looking to transcribe spoken English words into text or convert text into natural-sounding speech, this project provides a user-friendly interface and robust functionality.
**Contribution:**
I welcome contributions to enhance features, improve the interface, optimize performance, or expand language support. 
THANKS!
